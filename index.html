<h1>BIRD!</h1>
<img src="qwe.jpg">
  <p>Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs,[3] are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. As a subgroup of Reptilia, birds are the closest living relatives of crocodilians, while birds and crocodilians together are the last living representatives of Archosaurs.</p>
